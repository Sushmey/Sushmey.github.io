I'm an incoming Computer Science graduate student at <nobr><b>CU Boulder</b></nobr>, with 2 years of experience as a software developer. I'm proficient in technologies like Python, Java, SQL, Spark, Hive, Django, Flask and Express.

Prior to grad school, I worked as a Software Engineer at <nobr><b>Wells Fargo</b></nobr>, where I built data processing frameworks, and interned at **Barclays**, working on trade feed file generation to improve turnaround time. 

In addition to industry experience, I have also contributed extensively to [Zulip Terminal](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-terminal/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ASushmey+sort%3Acomments-desc), an open-source terminal-based chat client.

I completed my undergraduate degree in Information Technology from VJTI, Mumbai.
