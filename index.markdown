I am an incoming Computer Science Graduate student at CU Boulder. I'm a software developer with about 2 years of experience. I've worked with various technologies and frameworks such as Python, Java, SQL, Spark, Hive, Django, Express, etc.

Previously, I've worked at Wells Fargo, building data processing frameworks and interned at Barclays. I have also contributed extensively to Zulip Terminal, an open-source terminal-based chat application.
