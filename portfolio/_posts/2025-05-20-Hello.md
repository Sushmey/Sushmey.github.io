Welcome to my personal webpage/blog! I plan on posting about my research, life, and everything in-between.   

I'm yet to post anything but stay tuned!

<!-- My primary research interest is in the design of efficient strategies for large-scale data movement through the use of novel message passing algorithms to communicate data between distinct compute nodes within a distributed system.

My dissertation work primarily focused on designing efficient communication strategies within the context of scalable iterative solvers for emerging supercomputer architectures, however, these strategies are data type and application independent.

Recent technological advancements, such as cloud computing and trends within AI, necessitate the management and processing of data volumes at massive-scale. Data movement within these contexts can benefit from the same locality-aware strategies I designed within my dissertation work and plan to continue researching in the future. -->
